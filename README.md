**[METADATA] Category of Proposal
Answer:**

Data tools

**[IMPACT] Please describe your proposed solution.
Answer:**

-   **How you perceive the problem you are solving**

  

We see the problem as the lack of platform as well as very few user-friendly platforms on the Cardano platform. Asset trading **(buy/sell, swap) real-time data analysis tools**, **token price charting tools (onchain & DEX)**, **wallet volatility trackers**, **trackers wallet portfolio**, project evaluation **reporting tool that automatically** supports exporting to file formats (images, pdf) and **overview dashboard** **insight** (BLOCKS, TRANSACTIONS, FEES, MARKET, TVL, VOLUME, INFLOWS/OUTFLOWS, TRENDING TOKEN, TOP PROJECTS ...) are still very few developers of these products.

  

Besides, big players like (coinmarketcap, coinecko) provide very little information about the original assets on the Cardano ecosystem as this is a big barrier to the Cardano ecosystem. So we will build & upgrade DCOneCrypto to a new version to help change that

  

-   **Your reasons for approaching it in the way that you have**

  

The reason we are reaching out is because of our existing strengths and building tools to serve the Cardano community & as the ETH, BSC, SOL community... navigate through the Cardano ecosystem There is also a common portal where they can see the current Cardano ecosystem value. Moreover, if the Cardano ecosystem increases the number of users, the current tools may reach the limit, which will temporarily shut down the system so we will build & contribute to share the number of users to reduce the number of users. high traffic load

  

Besides, we are an ecosystem that already has a project ecosystem and has built complete wallet monitoring tools, BOT price tracking, transaction tracking via Telegram, Discord so we want Upgrade and expand the functionality to the Website to serve the community

  

---

-   **Maintain website & BOT function Telegram, Discord, Webhook, API**

  

We list them first because in Fund 9 we were given budget support to build the following functionality: (Cardano Ecosystem Map, Add a new project, add a new IDO, ISPO, add a new event, add a new vote, Project verification, Track wallet stake balance to Telegram, Discord, Webhook, Project comments, Project ranking) so we will continue to maintain for the community to use the above function.

  

-   **DCOne Crypto Upgrade V2 & Wallet Integration** (Eternl, Nami, Lace, Yoroi, Gero, Flint, Typhon ...) to use website functions to replace traditional login (as a decentralized website) , votes, comments, events...).

  

> _Why do we have to improve the UI and upgrade the website?_

Since we are now a project information provider on the Cardano ecosystem, once we complete the upgrade it will make navigating the information easy. Community, users can search project information, create events, create votes, view comments, evaluate projects from everyone in a more public & easy way, and also use The little facilities we developed in Fund 9 last. From there, users from other ecosystems such as ETH, BSC, Sol, Avalanche ... will have an overview of project information on Cardano

  

-   **Analyze DEX price data & token price chart**

On the Cardano ecosystem very few providers analyze price data and transaction history, aggregate price charts of dex exchanges (Minswap, Winggriders, Muesliswap, SundaeSwap) when a large number of users move Moving to the Cardano ecosystem, the website providing tools will be blocked because the number of functional development websites is still quite small. At the moment we have taken the onchain transaction data of the exchanges and sent the results to Telegram, Discord, so we will develop these data and visualize the data on our website. So in the near future, community users when using our website will not need to navigate through DEX exchanges and now we will deploy in the following popular exchanges (Minswap, Winggriders, Muesliswap, SundaeSwap) at the same time will help balance the user load when using & an individual will not need to navigate away from DCOneCrypto to see the price at DEX exchanges

  

-   **Wallet Portfolio Tracker**

We are creating a portfolio tracker that will allow Cardano native asset holders to connect to any list of wallets (Eternl, Nami, Lace, Yoroi, Gero, Flint, Typhon...) see statistics, real-time data that their assets are in the connected wallet. View dex trading history, profit/loss, current asset value

  

-   **Reporting tool, project evaluation automatically calculates scores & exports fille (photo, pdf).**

Recently, DCOne Crypto has built a project evaluation function in Fund 9 with a basic level. After that, with the comments and problems we see and evaluate, we will publish more than 30 different evaluation criteria **(project information, development team, audit, tokenomics, community, etc.) trading metric and many other criteria...)** will be built by us in Fund 10 to measure the transparency of the project and the project's safety. At the same time, they will automatically calculate the project score through the results of the information you have entered to have a standardization basis for comparison between different projects and will support exporting photo and pdf file reports when needed by the user.

  

-   **Overview dashboard insight & global, trending**

There are also some developers who build statistics now **(BLOCKS, TRANSACTIONS, FEES, MARKET, TVL, VOLUME, INFLOWS/OUTFLOWS...)** but they don't seem to have trending tokens, project statistics, averages comment, rate, vote. So we developed the all-in-one feature.

  

We see that when community users in the ETH, BSC, SOL ecosystems ... accessing the Cardano ecosystem, it will be difficult to find the overall dashboard of the ecosystem as I mentioned. above. How can they see which tokens are trending, transaction size, volume, liquidity, highly rated projects, projects of high interest, projects with high scores (to minimize risk)? project risk). Because of the current advantage, we have aggregated data in Fund 9, so we will continue to upgrade and expand reporting functions. After completing the function, it will help users see general information about the Cardano ecosystem and projects on the ecosystem and you can share it widely on social networks.

  

-   **Article system & bounty distribution for article authors**

With the above system currently we want to build a knowledge library to promote and disseminate Cardano. We will be a place to store information with high reliability, and at the same time will break down the English language barrier. We have a team of translators in languages: Japanese, Vietnamese. Moreover, the community can also contribute articles to the available categories to enrich & diversify the content of the article information archive. At the same time, the article will be verified for the accuracy of the information by an experienced and technical member, as well as we have a translation team and a technical development team.

  

From there, the community will be equipped with blockchain knowledge, Cardano knowledge, Catalyst knowledge to improve the user's self-evaluation of the project and reduce investment risks.

  

In addition, any user can support the author with any $ADA, token or NFT through the function "distribute bounties to the author"

  

---

  

**In short, DCOneCrypto will be the platform:**

-   Update project information regularly on Cardano ecosystem.
-   DCOne Crypto Upgrade V2 & Wallet Integration
-   Provide access to chart analysis, DEX transaction history aggregate visualization tool.
-   Wallet portfolio tracker.
-   Project scoring evaluation reporting tool & support to export files (photos, pdfs) to share on social networks.
-   Overview & global dashboard insights, trends.
-   Cardano blockchain knowledge sharing article system & bounty distribution for authors.

**[IMPACT] How does your proposed solution address the challenge and what benefits will this bring to the Cardano ecosystem?
Answer:**

**The problem of the challenge**

  

Currently, there are very few developers who provide project information & project evaluation according to advanced criteria that support publishing automatic project evaluation reports via (image, pdf). Conversely, if the ecosystem maps are working but they have not built integrated overview statistics & global dashboard insights, trends. Moreover, the monitoring of real-time price data, aggregated price charts of (Onchain, DEX) still has many limitations that many developers have not built an integration.

  

**So we will continue to upgrade the product in Fund 9 to build functionality that will help the Cardano ecosystem.**

  

-   The user community can view the project overview on the Cardano ecosystem and export reports, view data to determine the level of project risk because of the research contributions you have made, you can share on social networks and others can benefit from the research you have done

  

-   These tools will increase the possibility of any business or individual participating in the Cardano ecosystem through several tools that analyze real-time price data on (Onchain, DEX), token price charts , wallet portfolio tracker, knowledge sharing article system for the community

  

-   When community users access DCOne Crypto through the "overview & global dashboard insights, trends" functions, they will see token trends, Cardano blockchain data report

**[IMPACT] How do you intend to measure the success of your project?
Answer:**

Number of tokens analyzed **real-time price data**, **token charting analysis data**

  

Number of connected wallets using **wallet balance fluctuations**, **wallet portfolio tracking**

-   (We have now built a basic article system that community users can write articles under moderation by the experienced team of DCOne Crypto and wallet integration (Eternl, Nami, Lace, etc.) Yoroi, Gero, Flint, Typhon ...) to the website and use ADA to support the author's reward)

  

Number of **projects listed on DCOne Crypto** by project owners

-   (Currently Fund 9 we built lists > 300 projects on DCOne Crypto and Fund 10 milestones we will be > 1000 projects listed)

  

Number of users **exporting project evaluation reports** to share on social networks, channels, groups

  

Number of users using **BOT to channel, group**

-   (Currently Fund 9 our BOT tools have been added by > 100 groups and used BOT tools & > 600 community users use at website, telegram, discord)

  

Number of linked users using **Webhook, API**

-   (Currently Fund 9 we have a number of developers linking, integrating and using our Webhook, API)

  

Number of **articles**, Cardano **blockchain knowledge** shared on DCOne Crypto website

-   (Currently Fund 9 although we do not raise capital to build the article system, we have balanced the budget ourselves and built the article system at a basic level)

  

The number of users accessing the website and the visitor **data reports according to google analytics**

**[IMPACT] Please describe your plans to share the outputs and results of your project?
Answer:**

**Phase 1: Maintain existing functions in Fund 9 of the Website, BOT & upgrade interface navigation, integrate wallets into the website**

-   The impact will help the community see the project overview about the Cardano ecosystem, project information, comments, reviews in multiple languages English, Japanese, Vietnamese and fully integrated utility functions in Fund 9, and the wallet will be able to use old functions and new functions to replace manual website login

**Phase 2: Building a real-time price data analysis tool, token price charts according to different time points (1h, 2h, 4h,**

**12h, 1d, 3d, 1w...) and wallet portfolio tracker**

-   The impact will help users view onchain transaction history, DEX exchange and use charts to compare token prices more easily and see profit/loss, tokens, nft currently in the wallet...

  

**Phase 3: Building an automatic project scoring reporting tool**

-   Impact will help users get general project reports and it will assist in assessing how good or risky the project is in investment, and everyone can share it. widely on social networks.

  

**Phase 4: Building an overview dashboard insight & global, trending**

-   The impact will help the community, businesses, and individuals to see statistics, overview data of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, they can use the metrics to compare with different L1 chains in the development process. Continued development later, everyone can also share widely on social networks to further promote the Cardano ecosystem that is being built and developed very well.

  

**Phase 5: Developing articles and distributing points for authors**

-   The impact will help everyone be equipped with Cardano blockchain knowledge, Catalyst, Cardano blockchain programming knowledge, smartcontract knowledge, plutus and typical Cardano related events. It is important that the information will be first checked and verified by the team before being published to the community, so it is believed that it will be a place to store reputable information and knowledge for people with languages (English, Japanese, Vietnamese)

  

  

> After completing all the functions I believe that **DCOne Crypto** is the place for everyone to use to view and use the developed functions to view information and use it widely for various purposes , believes that it will increase the ability of businesses, individuals, and communities to participate in the Cardano ecosystem

**[RESOURCES & VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
Answer:**

**This cost, if we are approved, will help the community:**

-   View the list of projects under (DEFI, DEX, LENDING & BORROWING, MARKETPLACE ...) that are developing on the Cardano ecosystem in many different languages (English, Japanese, Vietnamese...)
-   The user community can review project information, community contributions, public project comments from which they can make a decision to choose the right project to invest in.
-   We build real-time data analysis tools, token price charts will contribute to the community to see general transactions from DEX exchanges, see market fluctuations across tokens, and compare compare, check tokens quickly and conveniently
-   The dashboard insights, trends, the community will know how the Cardano ecosystem is working. Knowing the trends of tokens buying/selling with different volumes, users know the development, price of tokens through different 1d, 7d, 30d time hooks.
-   The article systems help raise awareness about Cardano Blockchain for many people and they will be spread and shared widely on social networks, articles ...

  

-> In short, the functions we build the team always put benefits for users and the community from the functions we have clearly described and that means we must have support from the community to get funds and continue to upgrade products, build new functions. Our team believes that the functions we build are essential for the Cardano ecosystem now and in the future when there is a large number of community users from other ecosystems participating. into Cardano
